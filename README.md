[Watch This!](https://watch-this.herokuapp.com/users/login) is a full-stack web application designed to help users remember movies suggested to them.

## Project Summary
Watch This! is a web application I designed and developed to help the everyday person 'remember' movies suggested to them by friends or family. It is designed to allow users to search for the movie suggested to them and store in a list specific to them. Watch This! also allows users to browse the most watched movies among the app's users.
